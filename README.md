# Billable bookmarklet for 10k

A JS bookmarklet to tell you what percentage of your time in the given week is billable. Requires the browser to have the 10k time tracker open.

## Build

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

This is a simple process to make the JS more bookmark-friendly. Uses [Parcel JS](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).

After a build, you have to manually update the JS snippet in `index.html`.
